        <h3>Academic Experiences</h3>
        <p>I am fortunate enough to have experienced numerous out-of-school activities that have provided me with new perspectives and knowledge in various fields. At the St. Louis Community College Summer Gifted Program, I was introduced to coding and photoshop through video game creation and animation, which has helped me in the building of this very website. At the Duke Talent Identification Program (TIP), I extensively studied and learned the art of debate for three weeks at Davidson College and was my first exposure to college-like life. My time at Duke TIP is what sparked my interest in possibly pursuing a career in law. Additonally, the numerous fields of medicine were taught to me at Anatomy Centered Education & Science at Logan University. The lessons of health, nutrition, exercise, ethics, and more still stick to me today where I apply them in my day to day life, especially with athletics. Finally, my most recent experience at West Point Summer Leaders Experience instilled discipline and a newfound patriotic ideal in my country.</p>

        <h3>Leadership</h3>
        <p>Being a leader was a trait that didn't always come naturally to me, but over the years as I have grown my communication skills and realized the importance of leadership I have molded myself into one. I am the Student Body Treasurer for my school's Student Council where I have helped in events such as fundraisers and most notably in organizing our school's prom. I am also the Secretary of my school's National Honor Society where I help with the chapter and volunteer for events. Futhermore, I am the co-president of Ladue History Club where I help plan and deliver lectures about history and competed in the Academic World Quest National competition in Washington D.C. </p>

        <h3>Sports</h3>
        <p>I've always enjoyed the outdoors and physical activity, prompting me to try out many different sports throughout my life. I played soccer and baseball, competed for a community swim team, got into wrestling and basketball, and even tried out football and cross country, but ultimately I came to love tennis. Tennis is an individual sport, but can be played with a team. As an individual sport, tennis requires a strong mindset and positive attiutude in the face of constant adversity, but when playing on a team, strategy, cooperation, coordination, and support must also be taken into account. That's why I love tennis, and why I joined my high school's varsity team where we won the state championship for the first time in 27 years, and then won it the very next year back-to-back with me as a captain. My journey with tennis has taught me many lessons in perseverance, self-confidence, strategy, and much more, but most importantly, in cooperation and teamwork that allowed for our high school team to be so triumphant. </p>

        </a>
        <h3>Music and Arts</h3>
        <p>Music has been a critical part of my life as I have been playing the piano and violin for years and have been enrolled in my schools orchestra since 5th grade. I, like most others, have always enjoyed listening to music, but actually creating music is actually a much more rewarding process in my opinion. The reason being is that the entire ensemble must depend on each other to have adequate tone, intonation, phrasing, and more in order to produce quality sound, and if even one person is not in sync with that, it is quite distinguishable. Similarly, lion dancing requires all particpates to be on board with each other. Most obviously the head and back must move with each other, but we also have to been in line and on time with the other lion, but if we were able to do that we can create a great performance. So although lion dance had started as quite foreign and difficult for me as first, it too has become a very rewarding experience, especially since it is all volunteered and promotes diversity and culture throughout the community.</p>
